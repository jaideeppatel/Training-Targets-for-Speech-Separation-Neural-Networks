This is a template outlining the functions we are expecting for us to be able to
interface with an call your code. This is not all of the functions you need. You
will also need to make sure to bring your decision tree learner in somehow
either by copying your code into a learn_decision_tree function or by importing
your decision tree code in from the file your wrote for PA#1. You will also need
some functions to handle creating your data bags, computing errors on your tree,
and handling the reweighting of data points.

For building your bags numpy's random module will be helpful.

Function: load_and_split_data(datapath)
datapath: (String) the location of the UCI mushroom data set directory in memory

This function loads the data set. datapath points to a directory holding
agaricuslepiotatest1.csv and agaricuslepiotatrain1.csv. The data from each file
is loaded and returned. All attribute values are nomimal. 30% of the data points
are missing a value for attribute 11 and instead have a value of "?". For the
purpose of these models, all attributes and data points are retained. The "?"
value is treated as its own attribute value.

Two nested lists are returned. The first list represents the training set and
the second list represents the test set.

Function: learn_bagged(tdepth, numbags, datapath)
tdepth: (Integer) depths to which to grow the decision trees
numbags: (Integer)the number of bags to use to learn the trees
datapath: (String) the location in memory where the data set is stored

This function will manage coordinating the learning of the bagged ensemble.

Nothing is returned, but the accuracy of the learned ensemble model is printed
to the screen.

Function: learn_boosted(tdepth, numtrees, datapath)
tdepth: (Integer) depths to which to grow the decision trees
numtrees: (Integer) the number of boosted trees to learn
datapath: (String) the location in memory where the data set is stored

This function wil manage coordinating the learning of the boosted ensemble.

Nothing is returned, but the accuracy of the learned ensemble model is printed
to the screen.
